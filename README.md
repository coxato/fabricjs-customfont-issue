# fabricjs-customfont-issue
trying to fix an issue with custom fonts with fabric js (they look different, browser vs nodejs)

# install dependencies
`npm install`

# how to test it 
### for frontend: 
It works good in browser, to run the file you just need to type
`node runbrowser.js` then enter to `http://localhost:3000`

### for backend (nodejs)
type `node runnode.js` and once you see a message ("finished") open the file generated with this name **nodegenerated.jpg**
